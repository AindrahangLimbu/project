        <p>Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans.
             Darkly colored, bitter, a
            nd slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on
             humans, primarily due to its
             caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world 
             market for hot drinks</p>
        <br>
        <p>Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to
             produce unroasted green coffee beans. 
            The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles
             that are typically steeped in hot water 
            before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
             It is usually served hot, although chilled or 
            iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and
             presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
             French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned 
             coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and 
             cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or 
             enhance the flavor.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roasted coffee beans</p>
        <p style="color: darkslategray;">Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history 
            tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking 
            in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, 
            where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. The Yemenis procured 
            the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached 
            the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a 
            global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.</p>
        <P style="color: sienna;">The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. 
            robusta.[3] Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions
             of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the 
             leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted coffee is
              traded as an agricultural commodity. Despite sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars worldwide, 
              farmers producing coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have 
              also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.</P>

       <h1 style="color: darkred;">Etymology</h1>
        <img src="Coffee_beans_unroasted.jpg">The word coffee entered the English language in
         1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve (قهوه), borrowed 
         in turn from the Arabic qahwah (قَهْوَة).[4] Medieval Arab lexicographers traditionally held that the etymology of qahwah meant 'wine', given its distinctly dark color, and derived from the verb qahiya (قَهِيَ), 'to have no appetite'
        <p>The word qahwah most likely meant 'the dark one', referring to the brew or the bean; 
            qahwah is not the name of the bean, which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Cushitic
             languages as būn. Semitic languages had the root qhh, 'dark color', which became a natural
              designation for the beverage. Its cognates include the Hebrew qehe(h) ('dulling') and the Aramaic
               qahey ('give acrid taste to').[5] although Arab etymologists have connected it with a word meaning 
               "wine"; but it is perhaps rather from the Kaffa region of Ethiopia. [6]</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: blue;">The terms coffee pot and coffee break originated in 1705 and 1952 respectively</p>

        <p>There are multiple anecdotal origin stories which lack evidence. In a commonly repeated legend, Kaldi, 
            a 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd, first observed the coffee plant after seeing his flock energized by 
            chewing on the plant.[8] This legend does not appear before 1671, first being related by Antoine Faustus
             Nairon, a Maronite professor of Oriental languages and author of one of the first printed treatises devoted
              to coffee, De Saluberrima potione Cahue seu Cafe nuncupata Discurscus (Rome, 1671), indicating the story is
               likely apocryphal.[9][10][8] Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. Omar,
                starving after being exiled from Mokha, found berries. After attempting to chew and roast them, Omar boiled
                 them, which yielded a liquid that revitalized and sustained him.[11]</p>
        <h2 style="color: darkred;">Historical transmission</h2>
        <img src="The_Vertue_of_the_COFFEE_Drink.jpg">The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking or
         knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed
          al-Ghaffar in Yemen.[12] It was in Yemen that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in
           a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for
            their religious rituals.[13] Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to 
            its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade 
            across the Red Sea.[14] One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden 
            from the African coast,[15] other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was
             the first to introduce coffee to Arabia.[15][16] According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have
              encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401.

        Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings a beverage called qahwa 
        developed from a tree in the Zeila region located in the Horn of Africa.[13] Coffee was first exported 
        from Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured
         from Harar and the Abyssinian interior. According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden
          (1839–1854), Mocha historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based merchants before
           the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. Thereafter, much of the
            Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.[17]
        <p>By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and North Africa.[18] The 
            first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India during the time. 
            Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilized. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having 
            smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were
             planted in Mysore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp<img src="The_Vertue_of_the_COFFEE_Drink.jpg"></p>
